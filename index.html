They are best viewed
          from afar. Putting them under the microscope makes for a
          awkward experience, both for the person introducing himself
          or for the person hearing or reading it. So indulge me a
          little and call your suspension of disbelief while I take
          the stage to address you.</p><p>I'm very much interested on the web and everything that
          revolves around it. Which translates in to a lot of
          stuff. By web I mean all technologies that enable it. From
          the OS to the application. I consider that mobile makes part
          of the web, understood as a way of providing streams that we
          can get immersed in. The famous Robert Heinlein <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein#Time_Enough_for_Love_.281973.29">quote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Specialization is for insects.</p></blockquote><p>applies to the web. Therefore having a cross sectional
         knowledge of the web stack is tantamount
         to <b>grokking</b> it. To use another Heinleinism.</p><p><a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> is my choice
             for Content Management Systems, or in the case of
             Drupal, <b>framework</b> is more appropriate. Before
             you jump to conclusions I don't think PHP is a "great"
             language. But I find it interesting in a low tech sort of
             way, since it's capable of achieving so much, while
             hardly being the greatest language design under the
             Sun. When I listen to language zealots (mostly Ruby
             wannabe ninjas) trashing PHP I recall what the
             great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus_Harnoncourt">Nikolaus
             Harnoncourt</a> says about playing early music on modern
             instruments:</p><blockquote><p>It's more important what you have in your head as a
          performer of Early Music than the instrument that you play.</p></blockquote><p>Do you grok the manifold implications of this sentence
         in the programming world?</p><p><a href="http://nginx.org">Nginx</a> is a modern
         high performance web server. It's now sort of an obsession
         for me. I no longer use Apache and even never ever touched
         IIS.
         I maintain my Nginx configs here, namely the
         one
         for <a href="https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx">running
         Drupal with Nginx</a>.</p><p>I've been
         using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a> since
         I couldn't grok vi on a good old DECstation 5100 running
         Ultrix. I came to Unix from VMS and specially its great
         editor EDT. vi was a big jump backward. Today I use mostly vi
         when I'm editing config files as root. For the rest, I'm a
         man of simple tastes: I use emacs.</p><p>I mantain
         a <a href="https://github.com/perusio/magit">github
         fork</a> of the "official" <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a> repo on github. This fork
         differs from the original repo only in the extent that a
         debian build setup for creating the package is
         incorporated. Basically it's a <b>debianization</b> of
         the official version. The official debian version available
         on <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/magit">unstable (sid)</a>
         lags considerably from the current development version.</p><p>I'm a
         big <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
         fan. I happen to think it's the <b>greatest</b> language
         ever invented. Lisp is a huge advantage for developing new
         projects since it allows you to quickly hack something
         together in order to try a concept. I use it a lot when
         developing sites and products in Drupal. For instance: I
         use <a href="http://clsql.b9.com/">clsql</a> for data
         migration tasks. This page was built in Lisp and then
         compiled to HTML using a fork
         of <a href="http://lml2.b9.com/">LML2</a> I
         mantain <a href="https://github.com/perusio/lml2-html5">here</a>.</p><p>I'm now a interested
                       in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language">Lua</a>
                       : a language with a clear Lispy heritage. Even if
                       the syntax is rather different. My interest was
                       stoked by the
                       powerful <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule">Embedded Lua Module</a> for
                                       Nginx. And advanced features
                                       like JIT compilation, prototypical inheritance and
                                       more.</p><p>Here is the list of all my projects on github: <br /><code><a href="https://github.com/perusio">https://github.com/perusio</a></code></p><p>I mantain a <a href="http://debian.perusio.net/debian.html">debian</a> repository with some of the stuff I host here.</p><p>Outside of coding I'm obsessed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCqJe-zSoE0">Late medieval Italian music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwbpnl07rTs">cinema</a>.</p><footer><a class="nav-top" href="#top">goto top</a><div class="license"><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/pt" rel="license" class="normalTip" title="Licença CC-BY Portugal">cb</a></div></footer></section><time datetime="2012-02-11T21:18:30Z" pubdate>Updated February 11 2012</time></div><div class="unit size15of48 lastUnit"><div class="sidebar-right"><aside><img src="img/appa_photo_blog.png" /></aside></div></div></div></article></div></body></html>
